# About me

I earned my Associates degree in Information Technology from the [Pitt Community College](https://www.unitn.it/) in 2022 and am currently exploring further education options in the field. I have experience with
a wide array of software tools and languages, most recently being with C++ (with Qt), C# (.NET Core), and SQL Server. I also have experience buuilding web interfaces and mobile applications with front end technologies such as Typescript, React, and C# (Net Maui).

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve developed an interest in Christian theology and history. I began reading more about early Christianity, the Gospels, and the historical Jesus and have longed for a place start sharing my thoughts around that as well.

In the remainder of my spare time, I enjoy fishing, [reading](/bookshelf), [writing](/posts), and spending time with my wife and our dog and cat.

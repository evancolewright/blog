# Hi, I'm Evan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **software engineer** adept in a wide range of technologies and stacks. I absolutely love learning new tech and solving difficult problems along the way.

I'm also an **enthusiast** of early Christianity and enjoy [reading](/bookshelf) and studying the Gospels and history surrounding the earliest Christians.
